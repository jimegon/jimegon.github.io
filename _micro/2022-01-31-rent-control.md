**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
What do you do when the price of rent keeps rising and rising? One simple policy is to cap the rent. Some cities and states are considering rent control policies right now, even though the majority of economists view this policy as counterproductive. In fact, those economists say rent control actually makes housing unaffordability worse.

Jerusalem Demsas is a policy reporter at Vox and a former critic of rent control. But struggles to build more housing in high-cost cities have caused her to change her mind. Today, she joins the show to explain why.
