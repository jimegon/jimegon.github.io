Abstract
</summary>
<p>
Over the past 15 years (2010-2024) in New York City (NYC), there have been more than 20,000 drinking water quality complaints. This paper presents descriptive and spatiotemporal analytics results using these open public NYC311 datasets. The authors emphasize the importance of data analytics and advocate for collaborative work among researchers, water utilities, practitioners, and other critical stakeholders. This combined approach is essential for achieving a comprehensive understanding of water quality, which will help lead to the sustainable management and operation of drinking water infrastructure systems.
