Abstract
</summary>

<p>
Inspired by “One La Salle,” a global initiative for collaboration among Lasallian institutions to strengthen the effectiveness of our mission, members from Manhattan College in New York City and Universidad de La Salle in Bogotá and Yopal, Colombia, are collaborating to strengthen our joint mission in research and teaching opportunities connected to social justice. In this article, we summarize the various collaboration projects and their connections to social justice. We illustrate the diversity of exciting projects that can arise through global partnerships within the One La Salle network. The projects are proposed by economics, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, education, and science faculty members. In addition to describing each project, we include research questions and hypotheses that will be studied. We conclude with recommendations for other Lasallian institutions that may embark on a similar quest to strengthen our Lasallian missions within the global Lasallian network.
