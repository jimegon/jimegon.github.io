Abstract
</summary>

<p>
Environmental and natural resource economics (ENRE) is a rapidly growing economics field, creating challenges for instructors seeking to bring these advances into the classroom. This paper creates an easy-to-use guide to the large volume of journal articles on teaching ENRE. We include cross-referenced tables for quick review, detailed summaries for more in-depth understanding, and categorize each of the articles according to topic and pedagogy. We identify an impressive set of resources that instructors can use to engage students. The most common ENRE topic in these 54 articles is incentive-based approaches for addressing externalities, and more specifically, marketable pollution permits. The least developed topics were those focused on conservation, sustainability, and climate change.
