Abstract
</summary>

<p>
Water quality problems remain severe across much of the United States. Improvements are particularly challenging in agricultural regions where upwards of 90 percent of the pollution load comes from sources that fall outside regulatory control under the Clean Water Act. These nutrient sources are responsible for a large “dead” zone in the Gulf of Mexico, the closure of Toledo’s drinking water facility, and ubiquitous damage to recreational amenities. The promotion of a new agricultural pollution abatement technology, cover crops, through cost-share funding opportunities combined with a longitudinal data set including information on adopters both before and after introduction of the subsidy program provides a clear identification strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of funding for this promising new abatement technology. Using propensity score matching and a tobit estimator to correct for non-adoption, we find that costshare funding significantly increases the proportion of cover crops planted and cover crops acres among both recipients of funds and among adopters.These results have critical implications for
finding solutions to address persistent water quality problems with limited conservation budgets.
