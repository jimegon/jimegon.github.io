**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
In the 1970s, manatees were on the brink of extinction, endangered by speed boats and a disappearing habitat. But when power companies noticed manatees hanging out near their power plants in search of warm water, they saw an opportunity.

The power companies proposed working together with environmentalists. That alliance helped to turn the warm waters of the power plants into manatee refuges â€” helping to save the sea cows, while potentially saving the power companies hundreds of millions of dollars. But nearly fifty years later, there's a new dilemma: Florida's manatees are hooked on fossil fuels.
