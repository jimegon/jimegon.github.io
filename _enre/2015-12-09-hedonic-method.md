This video is a part of Conservation Strategy Fund's collection of environmental economics lessons and was made possible thanks to the support of Jon Mellberg and family.  This series is for people who want to learn - or review - the economics of conservation.  The Valuation series will look at the process of estimating the value of an ecosystem.  This video takes a closer look at how to calculate the value of ecosystem services by looking at housing prices near natural ecosystems.
