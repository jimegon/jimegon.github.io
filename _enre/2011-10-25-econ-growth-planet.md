Economists love economic growth. It's an essential driver of rising living standards.

But on today's show, we wrestle with a question we've heard a lot from our listeners: Is economic growth bad for the planet?

We talk to one economist, Herman Daly, who argues that economic growth is in fact environmentally unsustainable.

And we hear from a second, Robert Mendelsohn who says economic growth and a healthy environment can co-exist â€” but who argues we should include the effects of pollution in the price of electricity.
