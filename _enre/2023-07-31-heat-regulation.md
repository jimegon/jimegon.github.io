**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
It's been a summer of record breaking heat. And for both outdoor and indoor workers, that heat poses a growing health risk. Around the country, worker advocates and industry groups are in an ongoing fight over how to address extreme heat and workplace safety. And that got The Indicator team thinking about an episode we did last year.

Co-hosts Adrian Ma and Darian Woods spoke to an economist who said heat safety regulations could be a win-win-win for workers, businesses and the economy.
