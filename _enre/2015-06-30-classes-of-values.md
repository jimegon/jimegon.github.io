This video is a part of Conservation Strategy Fund's collection of environmental economics lessons and was made possible thanks to the support of Jon Mellberg and family.  This series is for people who want to learn - or review - the economics of conservation.  The Valuation series will look at the process of estimating the value of an ecosystem.  This video will look at the difference between indirect, direct, bequest, existence and option use and non-use values of ecosystem services.
