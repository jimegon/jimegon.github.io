**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
Ecuador's Yasuni National Park, a pristine corner of the Amazon rainforest, is home to jaguars, giant otters, and the golden-mantled tamarin. The park also sits on top of hundreds of millions of barrels of oil, worth billions of dollars.

The government of Ecuador faces a choice: Should it protect the park, or go for the money?

Until very recently, the country was trying to do both. The government said it would leave the rainforest untouched â€” if rich countries gave billions of dollars.

We reported on the story earlier this year. Today, we find out how the story ends.
