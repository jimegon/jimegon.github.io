This video is a part of Conservation Strategy Fund's collection of environmental economic lessons and was made possible thanks to the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Marcia Brady Tucker Foundation.  This series is for individuals who want to learn - or review - the basic economics of conservation.  In this video, you will be introduced to the concept of a cost benefit analysis.  You will learn the difference between decision making from the perspective of a private firm vs. a larger society and how this applies to environmental conservation.
