**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
China used to be America's market for recyclables. At one point it was taking about half the world's junk plastic. Turning peanut butter jars into socks.

But China's economy is different now. It doesn't want our garbage anymore.

What now? America's towns are slowly breaking up with recycling. And not just for economic reasonsâ€”economists are increasingly wondering if we are actually recycling...too much.

Today on the show, in the second part of a two-part series on recycling, we dig into why.
