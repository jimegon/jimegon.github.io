This video is a part of Conservation Strategy Fund's collection of environmental economic lessons and was made possible thanks to the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Marcia Brady Tucker Foundation.  This series is for individuals who want to learn - or review - the basic economics of conservation.  In this video, you will be introduced to the difference between public and private goods and how this applies to environmental conservation.  Concepts include excludability, rivalry, public goods, private goods, collective goods, and common goods/common pool resources.
