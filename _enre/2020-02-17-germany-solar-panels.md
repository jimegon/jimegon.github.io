**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
When solar started it had a problem: solar panels were extremely expensive and not very efficient. In this episode we head to Germany to find out how one country built a market to solve that problem.

On today's show, we meet the person who kickstarted the green energy market and learn about the wonky policy tool that helped him do it.
