**<span class="bold-podcast">Summary from website:</span>**
Your carbon footprint – everything from eating meat, to flying, and driving, all have carbon costs associated with them. We tell you what’s at the top of the American carbon footprint list, and then we take a step back and ask a bigger question...does your carbon footprint even matter? In this episode, we answer that question, and settle a sibling debate on individual actions vs. systemic change.
