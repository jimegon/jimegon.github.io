This video is a part of Conservation Strategy Fund's collection of environmental economics lessons and was made possible thanks to the support of Jon Mellberg and family.  This series is for people who want to learn - or review - the economics of conservation.  The Valuation series will look at the process of estimating the value of an ecosystem.  This video takes a closer look at how to conduct a market-based approach to valuation of an ecosystem service, specifically the avoided cost method. The avoided cost method in this case looks at how much money is or would be spent repairing or replacing property in a situation with or without an ecosystem service.
