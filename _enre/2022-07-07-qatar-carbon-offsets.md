More than a million soccer fans will travel to Qatar this fall for one of the biggest sporting events on Earth: The FIFA World Cup. The event sounds like it will be a climate nightmare, thanks to all the flights, air conditioned outdoor fields, docked cruise ships and brand new stadiums. But despite all this â€“ the organizers claim this month-long event will be carbon neutral. How can they say that? Thanks to carbon offset credits.
